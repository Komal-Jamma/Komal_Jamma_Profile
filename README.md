# Jarvis Profile Builder

ðŸ”¥Please see the [BSA_profile branch](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_profile_builder/tree/BSA_profile) for BSA specific instructions (e.g. `profile.md` is tailored for BSA)

As a Jarvis consultant, your profile/resume will be distributed to clients via various channels in different formats. The Jarvis Consultant Web App (screenshot below) allows clients to view your profile conveniently. The [markdown profile](./profile.md) will be displayed on your GitHub repo as the landing page. The [PDF profile](./jarvis_profile_John_Smith.pdf) is often required by HR systems. Therefore, keeping profile styling consistent is crucial.

Instead of writing various profile formats manually, the Jarvis Profile Builder allows a consultant to render/generate various profile formats by editing a single [profile.yaml](./profile.yaml) configuration.

# Quick Start 
ðŸ”¥Please see the [BSA_profile branch](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_profile_builder/tree/BSA_profile) for BSA specific instructions (e.g. `profile.md` is tailored for BSA)


Please follow the steps below to set up this tool in your Github repo. 

```bash
#cd to your Github repo parent directory
cd jarvis_data_eng_YourName

#make sure docker engine is started
docker info

#switch to the feature branch
git checkout master
git checkout -b feature/profile

#init profile dir
mkdir profile && cd profile && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_profile_builder/DEV_profile/profile_app.sh -O profile_app.sh && bash profile_app.sh init

#update your name from the profile.yaml file
vim profile.yaml

#Render/Generate different file formats
#Make sure you run this command prior to every profile pull request
bash profile_app.sh

#This tool will generate the following files
../README.md #overwrite your existing README
profile.json #this file will be consumed by Jarvis Consultant App
jarvis_profile_John_Smith.pdf #PDF version of ../README.md
```

# `profile.yaml`

This is the only file you should edit. The `profile_app.sh` will convert/render your `profile.yaml` into multiple formats for different purposes. 

YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language (similar to JSON but more human-readable). It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

# `profile_app.sh`

Usage:
```bash
#download sample yaml file
bash profile_app.sh init

#Render/convert the profile.yaml
bash profile_app.sh
```
The script will execute the following components documented below.ðŸ‘‡


### YAML validator
[Yamale](https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale) is used to validate the profile.yaml against the [profile_schema.yaml](./yamale/profile_schema.yaml). 

[jrvs/yamale](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrvs/yamale) docker image is available

### Markdown
[render_mardown](./render_markdown) is a Python tool that renders the profile.yaml file into a markdown file. The rendered markdown file will overwrite the `../README.md` which servers as the landing page for your Github.

[jrvs/render_profile_md](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrvs/render_profile_md) docker image is available

### JSON
`mikefarah/yq` docker image is used to convert the profile.yaml into a JSON. The JSON file will be consumed by the Jarvis consultant web app which allows Jarvis' clients to easily view all profiles.

### PDF
`pandoc/latex:2.9.2.1` is used to render a given markdown file into PDF

# Build your profile Steps

- [ ] ðŸ”¥Please see the [BSA_profile branch](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_profile_builder/tree/BSA_profile) for BSA specific instructions (e.g. `profile.md` is tailored for BSA)
- [ ] Read and review the examples provided in this repository. 
- [ ] Setup the profile tool in your Github repo by following the [Quick Start](#quick-start). At this point, you should only edit the name field before generating your first profile.
- [ ] Write your content first (using your favourite document editor), roughly following the format provided in the examples. In doing this, you will be able to quickly seek and implement feedback from our instructors without dealing with any technical issues relating to Git, the JRD, or yaml formatting.
- [ ] Edit the `profile.yaml` file from your favorite IDE.
  - [ ] Please read instruction/comments from the template `profile.yaml` carefully
  - [ ] Check your spelling and grammar through https://www.grammarly.com/ before each commit
  - [ ] Execute `bash profile_app.sh` (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)
- [ ] Open a pull request that merges the feature branch into the master branch (yes, you can skip `develop` and `release` branches)
- [ ] Senior developer and CSA will comment and review your PR.
- [ ] You will need to update your `profile.yaml` file for each project as part of the project closing the ticket. (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)

# Appendix: Project/Job Description
A project/job description allows hiring managers to understand the followings:

- Context (e.g. web app for store owners, a mobile app for students, etc.)
- Technical keywords, such as language, frameworks, design, tools, etc. (e.g. Java, Springboot, Microservice, REST API, Hadoop, Spark, etc.)
- Results and achievements (e.g. performance improvement, award, product delivery, etc.)

Please follow the simplified SDLC pattern that covers Design/Purposes, implementation/technologies, test (manual/unit/integration), and DevOps/Deployment to describe a project. Please see the sample description below.
```
#Design/Purposes
Developed an XYZ app in [programming language] which is used for blah blah. 

#Implementaiton/technologies
Implemented the app with Spring Boot, JDBC, X, Y, Z, etc.  

#Test 
Tested the app with Junit, X, Y, etc.

#Deployment
Dockerized the app blah blah.

#of course, the description should be in one line.
```

For non-technical projects/jobs, you can focus on soft skills instead of technologies (e.g. agile/scrum, team collaboration, communication, problem-solving, etc.)

A project/job description shall start with an action verb
  - Non-technical [action verbs](https://careernetwork.msu.edu/resources-tools/resumes/action-verbs.html)
  - Common action verbs for developers
    - Designed
    - Implemented
    - Coded
    - Programmed
    - Developed
    - Architected
    - Utilized
    - Collaborated
    - Worked
    - Initiated and lead
